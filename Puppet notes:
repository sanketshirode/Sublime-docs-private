Puppet notes:

- iteration functions
- defaults to be used for resources
- create resources function
- resource collectors
- metaparemeters(schedule)
- functions to get data
- autosigning agent certs
- components class should not use value directly from hiera
- data for modules goes from profile by pulling it from hiera
- puppetfile for installing modules	in environments 
- whenever a chnage is made in hiera restart puppet
- code manager manages and deploys code on master as per environments and we just need to push the changes in git
- use control repository for maintaining environment and code
- code manager overwrites existing environment
- while deploying using code manager dependencies needs to be explicitly specified in puppetfile
- Optional data type allows to pass the mentioned type or undef
- puppet queues up multiple requests for service refresh and restarts the service only once
- If hiera is used for classification then site.pp shouldn't have any node definintion
- for additional debug messages run puppet with --profile flag or --logdest and --debug
- create seperate repo for each module and add the module to master using Puppetfile from control repo
- Control repo consists of puppetfile ,hieradata and site.pp for roles invocations
- puppetlabs control repo is available
